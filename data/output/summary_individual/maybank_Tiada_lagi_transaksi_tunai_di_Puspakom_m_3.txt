The article discusses that Maybank QRPay, along with several other e-wallets like GrabPay, Touch â€˜n Go eWallet, Boost, WeChat Pay, and Alipay, will be accepted for all vehicle inspection payment transactions at Puspakom Sdn Bhd (Puspakom) starting from 1st July. Maybank QRPay is one of the digital payment options that customers can utilize to make payments at any Puspakom center nationwide. Since April last year, electronic payment and paperless reporting and receipts have been implemented in all Puspakom centers. However, cash payments were still allowed due to a small number of customers not having e-wallets or cards. Now, data shows that over 90% of Puspakom customers are using cashless transactions at all branches, indicating the convenience and safety of electronic payment during the current pandemic. For more information, the public can contact Puspakom Customer Service Center at 03-5101 7000 or via Live Chat at www.puspakom.com.my or follow Puspakom Sdn Bhd's official Facebook page.
