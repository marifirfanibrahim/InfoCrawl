Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is involved in a mega operation led by the Anti-Corruption Commission (SPRM), which has successfully dismantled a diesel fuel cartel in Sarawak this year. The operation, involving six operations codenamed White, Kingfruit, X, Sikaro, Metal, and Karen, has seized accounts and assets worth a total of RM960.73 million.

In addition to BNM, the operations were carried out with the assistance of the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN), Customs Department, CyberSecurity Malaysia, and other agencies. Op White targeted a government contract corruption scheme involving the seizure of accounts worth RM174.7 million, while Op Kingfruit involved an investment scam in Raub, Pahang with assets seized worth RM16.15 million.

Op X targeted a crypto currency fraud and Op Sikaro dismantled a cigarette and tobacco smuggling syndicate, seizing assets worth RM218 million and RM332.5 million respectively. The latest operation, Op Karen, targeted a diesel and petrol fuel cartel in Sarawak, seizing accounts and assets worth RM190.8 million.

The SPRM plays a key role in coordinating the investigations, gathering evidence, tracing funds and assets, and requesting international legal assistance. The SPRM is also working with the Attorney General's Chambers to seize assets within and outside Malaysia, as well as collaborating with US courts and other foreign agencies to recover stolen assets.

A recent exclusive report by Sinar Harian suggested that a company was involved in a cartel for the supply of diesel fuel throughout Sarawak, causing losses in the tens of millions of ringgit. The syndicate is believed to have paid bribes to 'insiders' to secure contracts or tenders for diesel fuel supply in the affected regions.

Following this, SPRM, through Op Karen in Sarawak, has detained five individuals including three company directors, a company executive, and a regional manager. Approximately RM34 million from 170 personal bank accounts and 50 corporate accounts have been seized.
