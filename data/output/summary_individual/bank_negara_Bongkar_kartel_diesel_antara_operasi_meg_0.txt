Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is involved in a mega operation, led by the Anti-Corruption Commission (SPRM), to dismantle a diesel fuel cartel in Sarawak. The operation, called Op White, Op Kingfruit, Op X, Op Sikaro, Op Metal, and Op Karen, has resulted in the seizure of RM960.73 million in assets and bank accounts. The operations targeted various forms of corruption, including crypto scams, tobacco smuggling, government contract fraud, and fuel price manipulation. BNM is collaborating with other agencies such as the Inland Revenue Board, Customs Department, CyberSecurity Malaysia, and the Attorney General's Chambers in these investigations. The exclusive report by Sinar Harian on September 9th suggested that a company was operating as a cartel in the supply of diesel fuel across Sarawak, causing millions in losses. The SPRM, through Op Karen in Sarawak, has detained five individuals involving three company directors, a corporate executive, and a regional manager. Approximately RM34 million from personal and corporate bank accounts have been seized.
