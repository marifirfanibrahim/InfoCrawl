The article discusses the ongoing construction of Masjid At-Taqwa Mukim Alor Pasir Wakaf Bharu, which is expected to benefit 1,650 local worshippers, particularly during compulsory prayers. The project involves building a two-storey mosque, with an estimated total cost of RM9.74 million and construction that began in March.

As of two months ago, the construction on freehold land has reached 10%, and the masjid still requires RM9.13 million for complete funding. The new mosque is expected to be ready by 2025, increasing its capacity more than twice compared to the current one that can only accommodate 450 worshippers at a time.

The existing Masjid At-Taqwa Alor Pasir, Wakaf Bharu was built in 1974 and has aged significantly, causing various damages like leaking roofs. The new mosque will have larger prayer spaces, offering comfort to worshippers during important events such as Friday prayers and the Aidilfitri celebrations during religious holidays.
