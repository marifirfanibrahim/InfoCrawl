Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is set to enforce the Consumer Credit Act 2025 at the end of this year, aiming to prevent consumers from making loans exceeding their ability, thus avoiding uncontrolled debts. The Chief Executive Officer of the Consumer Credit Awareness Council (CCOB), Abu Hassan Alshari Yahaya, stated that all BNPL service providers and controllers are required to share credit user data with reporting agencies for credit assessment before any transaction is made. This is to ensure consumers can only shop within their financial capabilities.

The Consumer Credit Act 2025 (RUUKP) introduced this year will also establish the Consumer Credit Commission (SKP) to monitor and enforce regulations on uncontrolled credit companies, including BNPL services, loan factoring companies, lease-to-own companies, payday lenders, debt collectors, and credit counseling and debt management agencies.

The approach will be phased, with the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDN) adding provisions to the Hire Purchase Act 1967 to provide fairer protection for consumers. This initiative will benefit the RUUKP Phase One initiatives. For Phase Two, the supervision of credit consumer activities under KPDN and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) will be transferred to SKP.

The BNPL industry has seen significant growth with over 5.1 million active accounts at the end of 2024, while transaction numbers increased to 149 million with a total value of RM12 billion. However, this increase also contributed to an increase in unpaid debts and hidden fees burdening consumers.
