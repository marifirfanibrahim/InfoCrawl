The article discusses the implementation of the Consumer Credit Act 2025, expected to be enforced by the end of the year, which aims to prevent consumers from taking loans beyond their financial capacity and falling into uncontrolled debt. This legislation will also establish the Consumer Credit Commission (CCOB) to regulate and enforce rules on unregulated credit companies, including Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services, lending and financing companies, loan assignment companies, debt collection agencies, and counseling and debt management agencies. The Consumer Credit Commission (SKP) will be responsible for overseeing credit providers and unregulated credit services that were previously unsupervised. This new approach will be gradually implemented with the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDN) adding provisions to the Rental Purchase Act 1967 to make it more fair to consumers, benefiting initiatives under the Consumer Credit Act phase one. For phase two, oversight of consumer credit activities currently under KPDN and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (PKHT) will be transferred to SKP. The BNPL industry has experienced significant growth with over 5.1 million active accounts by the end of 2024 and 149 million transactions worth RM12 billion, but this increase has also contributed to an rise in unpaid debts and hidden fees burdening consumers.
