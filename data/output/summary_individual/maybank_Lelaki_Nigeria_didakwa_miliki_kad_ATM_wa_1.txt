Maybank is involved in a case where a Nigerian man, Udoh Imeh, was charged at the Magistrate's Court in Seremban for possessing a Maybank ATM card of a local woman after his visa expired. The accused pleaded not guilty to both charges presented before Judge Nurul Saqinah Rosli.

According to the charge under Section 424A of the Penal Code, the accused is alleged to have possessed a Maybank ATM card belonging to a 44-year-old local woman with the intention of obstructing or deceiving the rightful owner from obtaining their rights. The offense was committed on September 8, 2025, at Desa Palma housing estate, Nilai.

The offense can be punished with a fine ranging from RM5,000 to RM50,000, or up to six months to five years in prison, or both, if proven. The accused also pleaded not guilty to the charge of staying in Malaysia after his social visit pass expired on September 12, 2025.

The defendant's lawyer, Renalyn Rivera, stated that his client did not intend to apply for bail yet, hence his passport was seized. The court then set a new hearing date on October 29.

Two other co-accused, Hendry Chinonso Udemba and Eric Onumah, were fined RM10,000 after pleading guilty to the same charge of overstaying in Malaysia after their social visit passes expired on the same date as Udoh. If they fail to pay the fine, they can be jailed for six months. Their lawyer, Christopher Joseph, pleaded for a lenient fine as they are married and have two children.

Clearly, the accused has admitted his guilt and has saved time for all parties involved. The prosecution is being led by Deputy Public Prosecutors Nik Nur Aqilah Syarfa Nik Zaidi and Norshafatihah Nor Azmi. Download the Sinar Harian app here!
