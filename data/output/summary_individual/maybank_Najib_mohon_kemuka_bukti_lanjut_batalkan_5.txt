Maybank is mentioned in the article as a company that was involved in the establishment of SRC International, a company at the center of a corruption case against former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. Newly discovered evidence suggests that Judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, who was the legal advisor and secretary for Kumpulan Maybank, had knowledge of Maybank Investment's role in the establishment of SRC. Muhammad Shafee, Najib's lawyer, stated that Maybank Investment Bank Bhd was responsible for proposing the establishment of SRC International, with its strategic arm Bina Fikir conducting research and providing advice on the matter. However, Maybank and its affiliates were not called as witnesses during the case proceedings. The Court of Appeal had previously upheld Najib's conviction and sentence of 12 years in prison and a fine of RM210 million for the corruption case.
