Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) was involved in an operation named Operation Karen, led by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (SPRM), which uncovered a corruption network in Sabah and Sarawak from 2 to 8 September. The operation, carried out by the Special Agents Team Force (MATF), unveiled a syndicate responsible for bribery and illegal fund transfers causing government losses totaling RM247 million over a period of 10 years.

The operation targeted various assets including 498 bank accounts, five Datuk individuals, 15 ships, 4.5 million liters of diesel fuel, nine luxury watches, gold, cars, and land worth millions. Individuals from six companies were arrested in relation to three company directors, a company executive, and a regional manager.

Operation Karen 1.0 focused on a company monopolizing commercial diesel supplies to an agency-owned Sarawak subsidiary by paying bribes to certain parties. Operation Karen 1.5 investigated illegal diesel smuggling around Beluran and the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) coastline in East Sabah. Operation Karen 2.0 targeted a construction company and several other companies suspected of bribing government agency employees to secure building contracts for an agency headquarters in Tanjung Lipat, Sabah.

Operation Karen 3.0, conducted on 8 September in Bintulu, involved investigations into companies and company directors associated with supplying and servicing Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas (MLNG). The operation seized approximately RM15 million from nine company accounts and six individual accounts, along with statements from five witnesses.

In addition to SPRM, MATF also involved the Inland Revenue Department (LHDN), Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), Ministry of Trade and Domestic Trade, Consumer Affairs and Entrepreneur Development (KPDNHEP), and Maritime Department. The operation was conducted under Sections 16(b)(A), 16(a)(A), 17(a), 17A, 18 of the SPRM Act 2009 and Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act (AMLATFPUAA) 2001.

A previous exclusive report by Sinar Harian on 9 September revealed that a company was part of a cartel involved in supplying fuel throughout Sarawak, believed to have caused millions in losses. The syndicate reportedly paid bribes to 'inside men' as payment for securing contracts or tenders for diesel supply in the affected regions.
