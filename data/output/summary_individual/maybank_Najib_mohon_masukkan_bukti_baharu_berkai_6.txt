Maybank Investment Bank Bhd may have played a role in the formation of SRC International Sdn Bhd, according to former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak's legal team. In a court hearing, it was argued that Maybank Investment Bank, through its strategic advisory arm Bina Fikir Sdn Bhd, was responsible for the research and advice regarding the formation of SRC. The team stated that Maybank's involvement in the formation of SRC had not been disclosed by the prosecution at any stage of the SRC trial, and no witnesses from Maybank, Maybank Investment Bank, or Bina Fikir Sdn Bhd were called or invited by the prosecution. The new evidence aims to prove that Judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali was involved in and had knowledge of Maybank Investment's role in advising on the formation of SRC in his capacity as an independent non-executive director and executive director of Malayan Banking Berhad. If proven, this could potentially make Judge Nazlan a witness in Najib's case. The article relates to Maybank as it suggests that one of its subsidiaries, Maybank Investment Bank, may have played a significant role in the formation of SRC International, a company at the heart of a corruption scandal involving former Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak.
