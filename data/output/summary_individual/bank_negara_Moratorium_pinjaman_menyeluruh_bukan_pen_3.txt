Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) advises that the nationwide moratorium on loans may not be the best solution for borrowers, following the reimplementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) across the country. BNM Governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus stated that all banks have plans to assist their customers, including a moratorium on loan repayments, which can be offered to borrowers who lose their jobs or experience a reduction in income.

Borrowers can also use various channels provided, including the Credit Counseling and Debt Consolidation Agency (AKPK), BNM, if they need additional advice or assistance. Nor Shamsiah emphasized that borrowers will receive specific financial aid to prevent them from accumulating more costs or debt than necessary.

However, a moratorium on loans may not be the best solution for all borrowers, according to her. This statement was made following the announcement of the first quarter 2021 Malaysia GDP growth rate on Tuesday. Nor Shamsiah also mentioned that BNM will consider implementing another moratorium after the government announces MCO 3.0, which is set to begin on May 12 and end on June 7 due to an increase in daily Covid-19 cases.

At this point, she encouraged borrowers to communicate with their banks to receive appropriate assistance tailored to their specific circumstances. As of March 21 this year, banks have helped 1.7 million applicants for loan repayment aid with a success rate of 95%. BNM and AKPK have also provided support to over 47,000 borrowers to help them meet their debt obligations with banks.

BNM assured that the records of the Centralized Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) will not be affected by the aid provided this year.
