Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has introduced new measures to stabilize the financial market amidst uncertainties caused by the global economic downturn. The measures aim to support domestic liquidity and ensure stability in the foreign exchange market. The central bank will provide additional funding facilities to commercial banks, lower overnight policy rate, and introduce targeted easing measures for the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector. Additionally, Bank Negara has taken steps to strengthen its surveillance over digital financial services to mitigate potential risks and promote responsible growth in this area. The implemented actions reflect Bank Negara's role as the institution responsible for managing the country's monetary policy, regulating the financial system, and maintaining stability in the financial market.
