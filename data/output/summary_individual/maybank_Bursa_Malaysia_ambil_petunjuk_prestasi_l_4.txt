Maybank shares increased by one sen to RM8.85 in the morning trading session on Thursday, following a negative trend from Wall Street and rising oil prices. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) decreased 0.15 points to 1,523.71, starting the day 0.55 points lower at 1,523.31. The broader market saw losers outnumbering gainers by 153 to 120, with 196 unchanged and 1,805 untraded shares. The total traded volume was 158.76 million units valued at RM72.95 million.

Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd stated that FBM KLCI closed lower in the late trading hours due to investors' concerns about rising inflation and cost pressures. Despite a negative trend on Wall Street, technology stocks could be further impacted, while the rise in Brent crude oil prices surpassing US$123, combined with a trucker strike in South Korea, may disrupt global supply chains and increase global inflation risks.

In the meantime, palm oil futures were traded around RM6,450 and showed an upward trend. In the focused sector, brokerage companies are optimistic about the tight oil supply due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and China's continued support for oil prices, which benefits the energy sector. They are also positive towards REIT, transportation and logistics sectors.
