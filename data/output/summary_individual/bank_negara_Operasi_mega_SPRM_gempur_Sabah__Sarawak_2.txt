Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is involved in an anti-corruption operation, Op Karen, which uncovered a corruption and money laundering syndicate that caused a loss of RM247 million to the government over a ten-year period. The operation was conducted from 2nd to 8th September in Sabah and Sarawak by the Special Task Force of Multiple Agencies (MATF).

Involved are six individuals, including two Datuks, who are directors and executives of companies. The operation revealed that a company monopolized the commercial diesel supply to an agency-owned company in Sarawak by paying bribes to certain parties. Five individuals were arrested in relation to this case, involving three company directors, one executive, and one regional manager.

The operation also seized approximately RM110 million worth of assets including 498 bank accounts, five luxury boats (RM52 million), 4.5 million liters of diesel fuel (RM9.7 million), nine luxury watches (RM1.2 million), gold bars (RM260,500), 17 luxury cars (RM5.6 million), and 40 pieces of land (RM11.3 million).

In addition, Op Karen 1.5 targeted illegal diesel smuggling activities around Beluran and the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) coastal area in East Coast Sabah. The operation recorded statements from five individuals and seized seven luxury cars worth RM2.2 million and 16 pieces of land worth RM8.3 million, among other assets.

Op Karen 2.0 targeted a company and several other companies that were accused of bribing government agency employees to obtain construction contracts for the agency's headquarters in Tanjung Lipat, Sabah. The operation seized approximately RM15 million worth of assets from nine corporate accounts and six individual accounts, and recorded statements from five witnesses.

Op Karen 3.0, which took place on 8th September in Bintulu, targeted a company and its directors in relation to the supply and services provided to Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas (MLNG). The operation seized approximately RM15 million worth of assets from nine corporate accounts and six individual accounts, and recorded statements from five witnesses.

The anti-corruption operations also involved the involvement of the Inland Revenue Department (LHDN), the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDN), the Maritime Department, and the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM). The operations were conducted under Sections 16(b)(A), 16(a)(A), 17(a), 17A, 18 of the Anti-Corruption Act 2009, and Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds from Unlawful Activities Act (AMLATFPUAA) 2001.

A exclusive report by Sinar Harian on 9th September reported that a company was involved in a cartel in the oil supply business across Sarawak, allegedly causing losses in millions of ringgit. The syndicate is believed to have paid bribes as a response to obtain contracts or tenders for diesel fuel supply in the affected states.
