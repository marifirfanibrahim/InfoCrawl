The article discusses a fraudulent syndicate using a fake MyBNM (Bank Negara Malaysia) app to deceive victims into transferring money without their knowledge. The Cyber Investigation Department (CID) of Bukit Aman confirmed that the victims in this case were contacted by suspects posing as Bank Negara Malaysia personnel. The victims are then asked to download the fraudulent app, where they are prompted to enter personal details such as ATM card numbers, PIN, and passwords. Once the information is obtained, the syndicate transfers money from the victim's account to a third-party account.

According to Datuk Zainuddin Yaacob, last year saw 53 cases with a total loss of RM1.1 million, while this year, up until April, there have been 57 reported cases with losses exceeding RM1.7 million. The police are committed to enhancing efforts from both investigation and operational aspects to combat the rise in such frauds.

The article also advises the public to be cautious when receiving calls asking them to download the MyBNM app or share banking information. It recommends verifying the authenticity through the CCID's website or using the SEMAK MULE CCID app. The MyBNM app, provided by Bank Negara Malaysia since November 2015, was terminated by the bank last year and an announcement regarding its discontinuation was made by the relevant authorities.
