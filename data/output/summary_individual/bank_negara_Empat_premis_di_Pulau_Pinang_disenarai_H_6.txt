The article discusses that four shopping centers and markets in Penang, which were previously listed on the Bank Negara's Hotspots Identification for Dynamic Engagement (HIDE) system, can reopen provided they have undergone thorough sanitization. This decision was made following a special National Security Council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin on Monday evening. The HIDE system is not intended to indicate cluster incidents at specific locations but rather serves as an early warning system. The reopening of these establishments, closed since Sunday, will occur tomorrow (May 11). This decision was made following a discussion between the Chief Minister of Penang, Chow Kon Yeow, the Director of Health Ministry in Penang, and the State Security Council of Penang after a brief meeting today. The shopping centers in question in Penang are Queensbay Mall, Gurney Paragon Mall, Lotus's Penang, and Aeon Queensbay.

The article is related to Bank Negara as it mentions the HIDE system that was initiated by the central bank of Malaysia.
