Bank Negara Malaysia's Hotspots Identification for Dynamic Engagement (HIDE) system has been used to identify four shopping malls and markets in Penang that were ordered closed earlier, which can now reopen after thorough sanitization. The decision was made following a Special National Security Council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Monday evening.

The Chief Minister of Penang, Chow Kon Yeow, announced the reopening of these premises in a media statement on Tuesday. According to him, HIDE is an early warning system and not related to cluster incidents at specific locations. The Ministry of Health will conduct risk assessments before ordering the closure of any listed locations.

The shopping malls in Penang that have been closed since Sunday are Queensbay Mall, Gurney Paragon Mall, Lotus's Penang, and Aeon Queensbay.

Last Friday, the government released the first HIDE list of business premises known to be hotspots for Covid-19 with the potential to spread the outbreak. The majority of these hotspot locations are in Selangor followed by Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Penang, Sarawak, Sabah, Putrajaya, Perak, Kelantan, Melaka, and Negeri Sembilan.

The Minister in charge of the National Covid-19 Immunization Programme, Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar, stated that the release of this list will serve as a guide for business owners to take precautions to protect their premises from becoming Covid-19 hotspots.
