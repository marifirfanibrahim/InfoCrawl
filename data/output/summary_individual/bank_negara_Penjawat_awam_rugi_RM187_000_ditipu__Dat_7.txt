The article discusses an incident where a 40-year-old man, also a government employee, lost RM187,000 due to the Macau Scam, a fraud scheme claiming to be affiliated with Bank Negara Malaysia. The scammers posed as a police officer from IPK Johor Bahru and contacted the victim under the guise of being a tax department official, alleging that the victim owed RM39,000 in taxes for his company.

The fraudsters then claimed that a Bank Negara court order would freeze all assets to prevent legal action, and convinced the victim to cooperate with them to avoid arrest. The victim was directed to provide banking information online, leading to the transfer of RM114,000 to a third party account supposedly belonging to a lawyer appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

The scammers continued to demand more money, totaling RM203,000, claiming it was needed for legal fees and as evidence that the victim was not involved in illegal activities. The victim eventually realized he had been scammed and reported the incident at Bachok Police Station.

This event is related to Bank Negara Malaysia because the fraudsters used the bank's name as part of their deception, claiming they had a court order from the bank to freeze assets and demanding money transfers be made to accounts supposedly belonging to lawyers appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
