Bank Negara Malaysia, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, is implementing a system called Hotspots Identification for Dynamic Engagement (HIDE) to track and control Covid-19 hotspots, particularly during Ramadan bazaars and Aidilfitri markets. These areas will be closed for three days if they are listed in the HIDE system due to their high risk of spreading the virus. The enforcement of these closures will be overseen by the Royal Malaysia Police, Malaysian Armed Forces, Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs, local authorities, and other relevant bodies.

The Government is closely monitoring standard operating procedures (SOP) and may strengthen them if there is an increase in daily cases, as suggested by the Health Ministry. This decision comes due to increasingly concerning trends in Covid-19 cases within the country, including the discovery of new variants. Certain states have already implemented Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) based on HIDE, which identifies high-risk areas for potential lockdowns.
