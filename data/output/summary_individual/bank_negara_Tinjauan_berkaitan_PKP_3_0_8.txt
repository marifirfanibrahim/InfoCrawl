Bank Negara Malaysia introduced new regulations for digital lending platforms, aiming to ensure responsible lending and borrowing practices. The new rules require platforms to verify the identity of users, assess their creditworthiness, and provide transparent interest rates. Additionally, they must have a clear dispute resolution mechanism and report data to Bank Negara. This move is part of Bank Negara's efforts to promote financial stability and consumer protection in the digital lending sector.
