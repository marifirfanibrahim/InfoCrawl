Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) reported a marginal 0.5% contraction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year, but this indicates a recovery from the negative 3.4% growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Governor of BNM, Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, attributed this performance to improvements in the manufacturing sector and agricultural recovery. He stated that the GDP for January and February decreased by 3.5% and 3.6%, respectively, but recovered to 6% in March.

The CEO of Malaysia's Economic Planning Unit, Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin, also revealed during the same press conference that all economic sectors showed recovery due to the reopening of more economic activities during the Enhanced Movement Control Order (MCO) 2.0. He added that the recovery was driven by increased household consumption and the impact of i-Sinar, i-Lestari, and palm oil and rubber price hikes.

The manufacturing sector grew by 6.6% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a growth of 3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by electronic, electrical, and optical products (10.6%) and petroleum, chemical, rubber, and plastic products (7.3%). Agriculture grew by 0.4%, while the service sector, which is the main contributor, contracted by 2.3% compared to a decline of 4.8% in the previous quarter. The slowdown in the service sector was due to food and accommodation sectors that declined by 29.8%.

Mohd Uzir explained that all components of household consumption showed signs of recovery, driven by exports and imports that recorded double-digit growth supported by an increase in goods.
