The article highlights the plight of a family living in Taman Pandan Jaya, Melaka, whose house has been vacant since it burned down 10 years ago. The homeowner, Jasnizah Karim, 40, lives in a house built on ancestral land along with her husband, Mohd Farid Zolkepli, 40, father, Karim Abu Bakar, 71, and three children aged five to 12. The family nearly got trapped in the three-bedroom house when it caught fire at noon. Fortunately, their eldest son managed to open the house door to escape despite heavy smoke. Due to the fierce and rapid spread of fire, they were unable to save valuable items including electrical appliances, estimated damages amounting to over RM100,000. The family is currently staying with relatives due to the cost of repairing the roof estimated at around RM40,000 which does not include other costs. They are unable to afford repairs as neither Jasnizah nor her husband works, and her husband earns approximately RM2,000 per month working as a hospital assistant. The family is hoping for financial assistance to help them rebuild their home and care for the elderly. The Maybank account number 114487056732 belongs to Jasnizah for those who wish to provide aid.
