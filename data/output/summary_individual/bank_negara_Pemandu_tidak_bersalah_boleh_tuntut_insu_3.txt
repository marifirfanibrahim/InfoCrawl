Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has introduced measures to simplify and expedite the insurance claims process for motor vehicle accidents, particularly for those not at fault. The new 'Own Damage Knock-for-Knock' (OD-KFK) policy allows insurance policyholders to repair their vehicles directly through their own insurers without needing to wait for the at-fault party's insurer.

This move is aimed at speeding up the process, avoiding additional costs, and maintaining No-Claim Discount (NCD) for drivers. To use OD-KFK, policyholders only need to submit a police report and related documents, after which the insurance company will handle the claim. However, OD-KFK is not applicable in cases involving taxis or accidents resulting in injuries, where claims must be made against the at-fault party's insurer.

BNM has also introduced Digital Roadside Assistance (DRS) to help policyholders get roadside assistance, find nearby garages, and send documents via mobile apps or websites of insurance companies. This eliminates the need for policyholders to figure out whom to contact or risk dealing with an unauthorized tow truck.

For cases that cannot be resolved, policyholders can take their grievances to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), a free service providing resolution for financial disputes. BNM aims to make the insurance claims process for motor vehicles more fair, efficient, and quick, thus boosting public confidence in the system.
