Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) introduces changes to the motor insurance claims process, allowing innocent drivers involved in road accidents to directly claim from their insurers without affecting the No-Claim Discount (NCD). The new 'Own Damage Knock-for-Knock' (OD-KFK) option allows comprehensive insurance policy holders to repair their vehicles through their own insurer without waiting for the at-fault party's insurer. This move expedites the process, eliminates initial costs, and maintains NCD for drivers.

The new policy also shortens the processing time for insurance claims, with self-damage claims processed within 20 working days compared to the current average of 45 days. Third-party damage claims can be settled up to 80 working days earlier. BNM also introduces the Digital Roadside Assistance service, allowing policyholders to request roadside assistance, find nearby garages, and send documents through mobile apps or websites of insurance companies. For unresolved cases, policyholders can escalate their issues to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), a free dispute resolution body.

The changes aim to make the insurance claims process more efficient and user-friendly after years of public complaints about bureaucracy and long wait times. The new policies are expected to provide a fairer, faster, and more transparent system, boosting public trust in the system.
