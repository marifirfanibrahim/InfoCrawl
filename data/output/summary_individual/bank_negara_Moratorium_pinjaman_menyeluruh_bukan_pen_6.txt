Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) advises that a nationwide moratorium on loans may not be the best solution for borrowers following the implementation of the second phase of the Movement Control Order (MCO) across the country, instead encouraging borrowers to communicate with banks to help them meet their debt obligations.

BNM Governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus stated that all banks already have repayment assistance plans including loan moratoriums, which can be offered to borrowers who have lost their jobs or experienced a reduction in income.

Borrowers can also use various channels provided, such as the Credit Counseling and Debt Consolidation Agency (AKPK), BNM, if they need further advice or assistance.

According to Nor Shamsiah, what's more important is that borrowers will receive tailored assistance to reflect their financial status, so they won't be burdened with more costs or debt than necessary.

However, she noted that a loan moratorium may not be the best solution for all borrowers. BNM also announced that as of March 21 this year, banks have assisted 1.7 million applicants for repayment assistance, with an approval rate of 95%.

BNM and AKPK have also provided support to more than 47,000 borrowers to help them meet their debt obligations with banks. She assured that the records of the Centralised Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) will not be affected by this year's loan assistance.
