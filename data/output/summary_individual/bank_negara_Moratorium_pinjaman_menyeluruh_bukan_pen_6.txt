Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) advises that the nationwide moratorium on loans may not be the best solution for borrowers following the reimplementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) across the country, instead encouraging borrowers to communicate with banks to help them meet their loan obligations. BNM Governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus stated that all banks already have plans for debt relief including moratoriums, which can be offered to borrowers who have lost jobs or seen a decrease in income.

BNM and the Credit Counseling and Management Agency (AKPK) have also provided support to over 47,000 borrowers to help them meet their loan obligations with banks. The governor emphasized that borrowers will receive tailored assistance to avoid taking on more costs or debt than necessary. Therefore, a moratorium may not be the best solution for all borrowers.

BNM has also stated that they will continue to use their resources to help borrowers throughout this challenging period. The governor also assured that the loan records in the Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) will not be affected by this year's relief measures.
