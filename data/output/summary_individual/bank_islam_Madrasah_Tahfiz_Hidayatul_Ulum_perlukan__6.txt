Bank Islam, a popular Islamic banking institution in Malaysia, has recently opened a new surau located in the Jaipin village of Air Tawar district. The purpose of this surau is to serve as a place for community gatherings and prayers while also providing amenities such as dairy products, kitchen utensils, and mosque facilities. In addition to these services, the surau has been constructed with modern facilities such as a dairy, kitchen utensils, and mosque facilities. The surau is expected to attract new members and offer a more convenient place for people to worship. To achieve this goal, Bank Islam has partnered with Aizaad Mohd Noor to build the surau, which stands at 185.8 meters high and provides ample space for community gatherings. The bank has also provided funding for the construction through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the government-owned Islamic Development Bank of Malaysia (Muis), which has granted a RM1.4 million loan to finance the project's expansion.
