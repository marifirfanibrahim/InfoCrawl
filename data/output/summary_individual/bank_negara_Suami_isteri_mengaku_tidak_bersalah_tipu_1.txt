Bank Negara Malaysia is involved in a case where a couple, Mohammad Riza Ahmad Hambadley and Wan Ziraiza Wan Ismail, are charged with 75 counts of fraud worth RM52.8 million that allegedly took place between 2016 and 2024.

The couple faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of five times the value of illegal activities or RM5 million for offenses under Section 4(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001. They are also charged under Section 137(1) of the Financial Services Act 2013, which alleges that they accepted deposits without a valid license, through a program involving payments for programs such as the Amal Kita Kinta Kampung Chicken Program and the Shami Goat Indigenous Breed Program.

The offenses occurred between August 16, 2017, and July 15, 2023, at No. 11A, Lorong Dewangsa 2, in Batu Gajah within the Kinta District. The defendants face up to 10 years in prison or fines of up to RM50 million, or both.

In addition, Mohammad Riza is charged under Section 3(2)(b) of the Scheme Act 2016 with five counts that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison or fines of up to RM50 million, while Wan Ziraiza is accused of conspiring with her husband in three offenses between March 3, 2017, and January 7, 2021.
